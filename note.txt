Straight: vertical and horizontal reflection symmetry, and two points of rotational symmetry
Square: vertical and horizontal reflection symmetry, and four points of rotational symmetry
T: vertical reflection symmetry only
L: no symmetry
S: two points of rotational symmetry only

Fixed tetrominoes (translated but not rotated or reflected)

There are:
two I
four J
four L
one O
two S 
four T
two Z
= for a total of 19 fixed tetrominoes

a. input validation size and newline
b. tetrominoes validation (19)

hint: recursive backtracking 
1. place
2. remove
3. increase solution size

hint: 
tetrimino as a structure that contained a height, width and character array
